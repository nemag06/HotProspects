I also improved my design skills by creating a visually appealing user interface that is intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, I gained experience in custom drawing and authentication, which helped me create a secure and personalized app that is tailored to the user's needs. The project challenged me to think creatively and solve problems in new ways, which helped me develop my problem-solving skills and improve my overall proficiency in Swift programming and SwiftUI framework._
